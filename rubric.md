## Mini Reflection

Name: Sophia

I think my program is a level 4+ because .... 
I beleive I have met all level 4 requirments and have gone
above and beyond through my extra features. 

The extra features I included in my program are: 
- Keyboard that changes colour of keys if input letter is in the word in correct spot/incorrect spot(similar to what worlde keyboard does)
- Checks word file to input so that only real words will be valid ( also game will not be broken regradless of input)
- matched colour scheme to worlde colours.
