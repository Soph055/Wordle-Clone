# Wordle Clone (JavaFX)

This project is a custom Wordle-style game built in **JavaFX**.  
The player has 5 attempts to guess a random 5-letter word. After each guess,  
the game provides visual feedback on the correctness of each letter similar to the original Wordle:

- 🟩 **Green** — correct letter in the correct position  
- 🟨 **Yellow** — correct letter in the wrong position  
- ⬜ **Grey** — letter not in the word  

The game includes:
- A dynamic on-screen keyboard  
- A textfield-based game grid  
- A dictionary validation system that checks whether the input word exists  
- Visual coloring of the board and keyboard  
- Random word selection from a list
